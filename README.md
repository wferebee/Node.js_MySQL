# Node.js_MySQL  by WILLIAM FEREBEE

# About
 ### This Node.js/ MySQL or (Bamazon) app is fairly simple. It creates a demo storefront where customers can "purchase" items and the databse updates in realtime and displays relevant info to the user. This is just a small demonstration, but in practice it shows what could be done on a much larger scale just using Node.js and MySQL.
 
 
 ## Technologies Used
  * Node.js
  * MySQL
  * NPM
  * NPM Colors
  * Console.table node package

 * installation of  Node.js and MySQL required
